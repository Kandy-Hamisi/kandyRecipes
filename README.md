# About The Project
KandyRecipes is an online recipe checker. A user is able to search for a certain meal like `chicken` then  variety of meals with chicken are fetched from an api.
Each of the meals fetched have steps that will guide the user on how to cook the meal.

## How it works
-Alert!!! - Site still under development
- User inputs text on the search bar then a search buttons appears
- When a button is clicked, the specific input will be queried to retrieve the meal
- results are displayed on a custom made modal

## Concepts used and applied
- Passing of array as props
- Conditional rendering
- High Order Components
- Uncontrolled and Controlled inputs
- useRef
- useState
- useEffect
- component reusability
- I used the Recipe Search API from [Edamam](https://edamam.com)
